# Problem 1
## 1. Theoretical Foundation

Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object launched into the air, subject only to gravitational acceleration. We derive its equations from Newtonâ€™s second law of motion.

Let an object be projected with an initial velocity $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal. The motion can be decomposed into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components:

* **Horizontal motion:**

  $$
  x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
  $$

  No acceleration in this direction (ignoring air resistance), so velocity is constant.

* **Vertical motion:**

  $$
  y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
  $$

  Here, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and the motion is uniformly accelerated.

To derive these, start from the differential equation of motion in each direction:

$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0, \quad \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g
$$

Solving gives the velocity and position functions as shown above.

### Family of Solutions

The general solution varies based on:

* **Initial speed $v_0$**
* **Launch angle $\theta$**
* **Gravitational field strength $g$**

Each unique set of initial conditions produces a different trajectory. For a fixed $v_0$, varying $\theta$ results in a family of parabolic paths.

## 2. Analysis of the Range

The range $R$ is the horizontal distance the projectile travels before returning to the same vertical level:

$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

### Dependence on Launch Angle

* $R$ is maximized when $\sin(2\theta) = 1$, i.e., $\theta = 45^\circ$
* Symmetric behavior: $\theta$ and $90^\circ - \theta$ yield the same range

### Influence of Other Parameters

* **Initial velocity $v_0$**: Quadratic relationship; doubling $v_0$ quadruples the range
* **Gravitational acceleration $g$**: Inverse relationship; weaker gravity increases range
* **Angle $\theta$**: Nonlinear relationship via the $\sin(2\theta)$ term

## 3. Practical Applications

The basic projectile model is idealized but can be adapted:

* **Uneven terrain**: Modify the vertical condition (i.e., the landing height $y = y_1 \neq 0$) and solve for time of flight
* **Air resistance**: Introduce drag force proportional to velocity; this leads to a system of nonlinear differential equations, typically solved numerically
* **Wind**: Acts as an external force; can be included as a constant or variable horizontal acceleration
* **Applications**: Sports (ballistics, golf, basketball), aerospace (rocket trajectories), engineering (civil structures and debris paths)

## 4. Implementation

A computational tool (e.g., Python script) can numerically simulate projectile motion and visualize how the range varies with different launch angles and parameters.

### Simulation Outline

1. Input parameters: $v_0, \theta, g$
2. Calculate trajectory: Use time steps to compute $x(t), y(t)$
3. Detect when $y(t) = 0$ to find range
4. Plot range as a function of $\theta$ from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$

### Graphical Output

* **Range vs. Angle Curve**: Typically a sine-like curve peaking at $45^\circ$
* **Multiple curves**: Show influence of varying $v_0$ or $g$

## Discussion: Limitations and Realism

### Limitations of the Ideal Model

* Ignores air resistance, which shortens range and flattens trajectory
* Assumes flat and level ground
* Assumes constant gravity (not true for very high altitudes)

### Suggestions for Realistic Extensions

* Include drag: $F_d = -kv$ or $-kv^2$, added to equations of motion
* Use numerical solvers (Euler, Runge-Kutta) for systems with drag or wind
* Account for terrain elevation and variable gravitational fields
